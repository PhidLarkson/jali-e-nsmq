1. For a metal to displace hydrogen from the dilute mineral acids that metal has to have a positive electrode potential
2. A mole of alumina would require 3 faraday of charge in electrolysis  to discharge one mole of aluminium.
3. In the electrolysis of dilute sodium chloride solution using platinum electrodes the concentration of the salt increases in the course of the electrolysis
4. Carbon(II)oxide from the exhaust of motor vehicles can cause acid rain
5. If the engine of a motor vehicle is in perfect condition no gas that cause acid rain will be found in its exhaust fumes.
6. In a forest region away from any anthropogenic activity, rain water cannot dissolve limestone.
7. The molar heat capacity at constant volume of a diatomic ideal gas is greater than that for a monoatomic ideal gas.
8. The molar heat capacity at constant volume of a diatomic ideal gas is twice that for a monoatomic ideal gas
9. The molar heat capacity at constant volume of a diatomic ideal gas is greater than that for a monoatomic ideal gas because a diatomic molecule has a greater number of degree of freedom than a monoatomic one.
10. When methylbutanoate is  refluxed with either dilute aqueous HCl or NaOH its pleasant smell will eventually disappear
11. A gaseous mixture of methane and chlorine will not react in the dark even when heated.
12. Subjecting pure ethene alone to high pressure will cause addition polymerization to take place.
13. The element with atomic number 21 obeys the Auf bau's principle
14. The valence configuration of 3s2 3px1py1pz1 is more stable than 3s2 3px2py1
15. The valence configuration of 3d10 4s1 is more stable than 3d9 4s2
16. Doubling the temperature of a given amount of gas from 25degree celsius to 50degree celsius doubles its volume at a constant pressure
17. 5.00g of neon gas atomic mas 20.0 will occupy the same volume as 4.40g of CO2 at 100kPa and 27degree celsius.
18. Argon atomic mass 40 will effuse from the same pinhole twice as fast as bromine gas atomic mass 80.0 at the same temperature and pressure
