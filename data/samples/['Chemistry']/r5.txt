1. I am a fully saturated hydrocarbon. I have a total of 8 carbons in my molecule. I can never be optically active because my molecule has a plane of symmetry. The longest chain in my molecule consists of 4 carbons and there are several ways of accounting for such chains. Two carbons in my molecule are without hydrogen atoms. So who am I?
