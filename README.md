## Downloading a Folder from Google Drive with Commands

This README explains how to download a folder directly from your Google Drive to a specific directory on your computer using two popular methods:

**Method 1: Using gdown (Python package)**

**Requirements:**

* Python 3 installed on your system
* `gdown` package installed

**Steps:**

 **Install `gdown`:**

   ```bash
   pip install gdown
   ```

 **Download the folder:**

   ```bash
   gdown --folder --id <folder_id>
   ```

   * This command will download the entire folder and its contents to your current directory.

**Method 2: Using curl (command-line tool)**

**Requirements:**

* `curl` command-line tool installed on your system

**Steps:**

1. **Get the folder ID (same as Method 1):**

   * Follow steps 1 and 2 from Method 1 to obtain the folder ID.

2. **Download the folder:**

   * Open a terminal or command prompt.
   * Navigate to the main directory.

   ```bash
   curl -L "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=<folder_id>" > folder.zip
   ```

   * This command will download the folder as a compressed ZIP archive named "folder.zip". You can rename the file after download.

**Extracting the ZIP Archive (Method 2):**

* Once the download is complete (Method 2), you'll need to extract the contents of the ZIP archive:

```bash
unzip folder.zip
```

This will create a new directory named "folder" containing the downloaded files.

**Important Notes:**

* These methods only work for folders shared with "Anyone with the link" permission.
* Be cautious when downloading from untrusted sources.

I hope this helps! Feel free to modify the commands and file names as needed for your specific use case.
